## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

I haven't worked a lot with buttons, so I learned how to create buttons with URL links
by using the onclick="location.href..." function:

````
<button class="button" onclick="location.href='https://frontendmentor.io.com'" type="button">Frontend Mentor</button>
````

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn about button functions and move into javascript more to increase my knowledge there.
